# Stacking

In astrophotography, stacking, also known as integration, is all about increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of your images; in other words, increasing the signal that you do want and reducing the noise you donâ€™t.
Unwanted noise in a typical image tends to be random across different exposures whereas the desired signal is consistent.

When a set of images is stacked, the individual image values are averaged, which means that the random noise overall diminishes but the signal remains constant.

This means that the ratio of the signal to the noise increases, resulting in a much cleaner, more detailed image with a smoother background.

## My Work...

I took some images from my phone with ISO set to 200 and Shutter speed to 10.\
The images are of 3468*4627.So if you want to see all the stars then you should download images, max your brightness and zoom.

#### After

Then applied some filter to the images to brighten up stars.

Then I will be doing some Stacking to reduce noise from image.
